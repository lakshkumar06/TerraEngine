### 2. **Click-Anywhere Map Analysis** 🗺️  
Users can click ANY location on Mars for instant AI analysis!

**Backend** (`backend/api/views.py`):
- ✅ `/api/regions/analyze_location/` endpoint
- ✅ Generates realistic location metadata:
  - Elevation (-8000m to +21000m)
  - pH (7.5 to 9.5)
  - Perchlorate levels (0.1% to 2%)
  - Water content (0.5% to 5%)
  - Terrain type (varies by latitude)
  - Major minerals (region-specific)
- ✅ AI compatibility score (0-10)
- ✅ Full AI insights via Gemini
- ✅ Complete cost analysis
- ✅ Metadata (water availability, perchlorate level, etc.)

**Frontend** (`frontend/src/MarsMap.jsx`):
- ✅ Pointer cursor on hover
- ✅ Click handler captures lat/long
- ✅ Top-left "Analyzing Location..." notification
- ✅ Preloaded AI & cost data
- ✅ Integrates with existing dashboard

**Frontend** (`frontend/src/SiteDetailsPanel.jsx`):
- ✅ Uses preloaded data for clicked locations
- ✅ No duplicate API calls
- ✅ Handles both string and number data types

**Flow:**
```
Click location → Analyze → Show AI Insights + Costs + Q&A
```

###3. **Gemini Region Recommendations** (NEW - READY TO IMPLEMENT) 🤖

**Backend** (`backend/api/gemini_integration.py`):
- ✅ `recommend_regions_for_crop()` method added
- Analyzes all 31 Mars regions
- Returns 5-7 best regions for each crop
- Different crops get different recommendations
- Includes AI reasoning for each selection

**What it does:**
```python
# Example: Tomato search
Gemini analyzes:
- Tomato needs (pH 6-7, moisture, temperature)
- All 31 Mars regions (pH, water, terrain, etc.)
- Returns top 5-7 matches with reasoning

Result: Gale Crater (8.5), Jezero (8.2), Utopia (7.8), etc.

# Example: Potato search  
Different results:
Result: Utopia (9.0), Arcadia (8.5), Gale (8.0), etc.
```

**Status**: ⏳ Ready to integrate into match_crop endpoint

## 🎯 Next Steps (User Researched Regions)

To complete the "User Researched Regions" feature, we need to:

### 1. Frontend State Management
```jsx
// Add to MarsMap.jsx
const [userResearchedRegions, setUserResearchedRegions] = useState([])

// When user clicks location
const handleLocationAnalysis = (data) => {
  const newResearch = {
    name: data.location.name,
    score: data.compatibility_score,
    isUserResearched: true,
    ...data.location
  }
  setUserResearchedRegions(prev => [...prev, newResearch])
}
```

### 2. UI Section for User Researched
```jsx
{/* In SiteDetailsPanel */}
{userResearchedRegions.length > 0 && (
  <div className="mt-6 pt-4 border-t border-gray-700">
    <h3 className="text-purple-300 mb-2">
      🔬 User Researched Regions
    </h3>
    {userResearchedRegions.map((region, idx) => (
      <RegionBadge 
        key={idx}
        region={region}
        type="user-researched"
      />
    ))}
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. Visual Design
- AI-recommended regions: Cyan badges
- User-researched regions: Purple badges with 🔬 icon
- Both lists visible simultaneously
- Click to view full analysis
