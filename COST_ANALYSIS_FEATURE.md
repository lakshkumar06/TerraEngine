## 💻 Implementation Details

### Backend (`gemini_integration.py`)

#### New Method: `analyze_cultivation_costs`

```python
def analyze_cultivation_costs(self, crop_name: str, crop_details: Dict, 
                              region_data: Dict, score: int) -> Dict:
    """
    Generate AI-powered cost analysis for Mars crop cultivation
    
    Returns:
        {
            'one_time_cost': int,           # Total initial investment
            'annual_sustained_cost': int,   # Yearly operational cost
            'breakdown': {                  # Itemized costs
                'transportation': {'cost': int, 'description': str},
                'habitat_construction': {...},
                'equipment': {...},
                ...
            },
            'enabled': bool                 # AI vs fallback
        }
    """
```

**Cost Categories:**

**One-Time Costs:**
1. **Transportation** (~35% of total)
   - Rocket launches
   - Cargo delivery to Mars
   - Logistics

2. **Habitat Construction** (~25% of total)
   - Pressurized greenhouse
   - Radiation shielding
   - Foundation work

3. **Equipment** (~15% of total)
   - Hydroponic/aeroponic systems
   - Harvesting robots
   - Climate control devices

4. **Initial Supplies** (~10% of total)
   - Seeds (optimized varieties)
   - Growth medium
   - Nutrients & fertilizers

5. **Energy Systems** (~8% of total)
   - Solar panels
   - Battery storage
   - Backup power

6. **Water Recycling** (~4% of total)
   - Closed-loop purification
   - Water extraction equipment

7. **Soil Preparation** (~2% of total)
   - Perchlorate removal
   - pH adjustment

8. **Climate Control** (~1% of total)
   - HVAC systems
   - Temperature/humidity regulation

**Annual Operating Costs:**
1. **Energy** (~40% of annual)
   - Power for lighting, heating
   - Life support systems

2. **Nutrients** (~20% of annual)
   - Fertilizers
   - Crop-specific supplements

3. **Water** (~15% of annual)
   - Makeup water for losses
   - System maintenance

4. **Maintenance** (~15% of annual)
   - Equipment repairs
   - System upkeep

5. **Labor** (~10% of annual)
   - Technician time
   - Training & support

**Cost Scaling:**
- **Lower compatibility score** (e.g., 2/10) → **Higher costs** (2x multiplier)
- **Higher compatibility score** (e.g., 8/10) → **Lower costs** (1.2x multiplier)
- Formula: `cost_multiplier = 2.0 - (score / 10.0)`

**Gemini AI Prompt:**
```
You are a Mars colonization economist specializing in agricultural cost estimation.

Analyze costs for {crop} at {region} on Mars.
COMPATIBILITY SCORE: {score}/10

Provide REALISTIC cost estimates in USD:

1. ONE-TIME SETUP COST (total)
2. ANNUAL SUSTAINED COST (total)
3. DETAILED BREAKDOWN (JSON format)

IMPORTANT:
- Vary costs based on compatibility score
- Lower scores = higher costs (more prep needed)
- Be SPECIFIC to crop needs and region conditions
- Use round numbers (no cents)
```

**Fallback Mode** (when Gemini unavailable):
- Algorithmic cost estimation
- Deterministic but varied (uses hash-based seed)
- Consistent results for same crop-region combo

          score: regionMatch.score
        })
      }
    )
    
    const data = await response.json()
    setCostData(data.cost_analysis)
  }
  
  fetchCostAnalysis()

## 📊 Cost Analysis Algorithm

### 1. Base Cost Calculation
```python
base_one_time = $5,000,000
base_annual = $500,000
```

### 2. Score Multiplier
```python
score_multiplier = 2.0 - (score / 10.0)

Examples:
- Score 10: multiplier = 1.0 (lowest cost)
- Score 5:  multiplier = 1.5 (moderate cost)
- Score 2:  multiplier = 1.8 (high cost)
- Score 0:  multiplier = 2.0 (highest cost)
```

### 3. Variance for Uniqueness
```python
seed = hash(crop_name + region_name)
variance = (seed % 20000) / 100
```

### 4. Final Cost
```python
one_time_cost = (base_one_time × score_multiplier) + variance
annual_cost = (base_annual × score_multiplier) + (variance / 10)
```

### 5. Breakdown Distribution

**One-Time Costs:**
- Transportation: 35%
- Habitat: 25%
- Equipment: 15%
- Supplies: 10%
- Energy Systems: 8%
- Water Recycling: 4%
