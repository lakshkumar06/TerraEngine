## 📊 Test Results

### Test 1: Direct Python Integration Test
```
✨ Gemini Enabled: True
⏱️  Response Time: 6.77s
Confidence: high
```

**Sample AI Output:**
```
Okay, here's an analysis of the provided data for cultivating 
tomatoes on Mars, targeted for Mars colonization planners:

1. Regional Suitability Summary:
   - Gale Crater (Rocknest): Highest potential due to equatorial 
     location and 2.0% water availability
   - InSight Site: Promising due to sandy soil alignment
   - Jezero Crater: Attractive due to past lacustrine environment

2. Key Challenges:
   - pH Adjustment
   - Soil Fertility Enhancement
   - Temperature Control
   - Perchlorate Toxicity
   - Water Management
   - Radiation Shielding
   
... [detailed recommendations follow]
```

### Test 2: API Endpoint Test
```bash
POST /api/crops/recommend_with_ai/
Body: {"crop": "carrot", "top_n": 3}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "ai_insights": {
    "enabled": true,
    "confidence": "high",
    "insights": "Okay, let's analyze the carrot cultivation 
                 prospects in these Martian regions..."

## 🔬 Sample AI Response (Carrot)

```
Okay, let's analyze the carrot cultivation prospects in 
these Martian regions.

1. Summary of Suitability:
   These regions are chosen primarily for their equatorial 
   location (relatively stable temperatures and sunlight) 
   and soil composition. Gale Crater (Rocknest) holds the 
   most promise due to potentially suitable water content.

2. Key Challenges:
   • pH Correction: Elysium Planitia and Gale Crater (Bear Island) 
     have significantly alkaline soil
   • Perchlorate Toxicity: Serious concern requiring mitigation
   • Temperature Control: Maintaining optimal 15-18°C range
   • Even Moisture Management: Critical for carrot root development

3. Specific Recommendations for Soil Preparation:
   [Detailed technical recommendations provided by AI]

4. Environmental Control:
   [Specific guidance for each region]

5. Success Probability:
   • Gale Crater (Rocknest): 55%
   • InSight Site: 45%
   • Gale Crater (Bear Island): 40%
```
