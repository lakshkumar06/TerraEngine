# Interactive Q&A Feature 💬

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Added an **interactive Q&A system** powered by Gemini AI where users can ask follow-up questions about growing specific crops in specific Mars regions. It works like a reasoning model with back-and-forth conversations.

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

---

## 🎬 User Experience

### How It Works:

```
1. User searches "tomato"
   → Sees top 5 regions

2. Clicks "Gale Crater"
   → Views AI insights about Tomato cultivation

3. Scrolls down to "💬 Ask Questions" section
   → Sees text input with example questions

4. Types: "What if we use hydroponics instead?"
   → Clicks "Ask AI" (or presses Enter)
   → Sees loading spinner: "Thinking..."
   → Gets concise answer in ~3-5 seconds

5. Asks follow-up: "How much water would that need daily?"
   → AI remembers previous context
   → Provides contextually relevant answer

6. Continue conversation as needed!
```

## 💻 Implementation Details

### Backend (`gemini_integration.py`)

#### New Method: `answer_question`
```python
def answer_question(self, question: str, context: Dict) -> Dict:
    """
    Answer user's question about specific crop-region combination
    
    Args:
        question: User's question
        context: {
            'crop_name': str,
            'region_name': str,
            'score': int,
            'conversation_history': [
                {'question': '...', 'answer': '...'}
            ]
        }
    
    Returns:
        {'enabled': bool, 'answer': str, 'question': str}
    """
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Context-aware (knows crop, region, score)
- ✅ Conversation history (last 3 Q&A pairs)
- ✅ Concise answers (2-4 sentences, 50-100 words)
- ✅ Specific to the crop-region combination
- ✅ Actionable recommendations

**Prompt Structure:**
```
You are a Mars agriculture expert. User exploring growing [CROP] 
at [REGION] (score: X/10).

CONTEXT:
- Crop: [crop]
- Location: [region]  
- Score: X/10

USER'S QUESTION: "..."

PREVIOUS CONVERSATION:
Q: [previous question]
A: [previous answer]
...

Guidelines:
- Keep brief (2-4 sentences)
- Be specific to this crop-region
- Give alternatives if explaining why something won't work
- Use practical, actionable language
```

### Backend API (`views.py`)

#### New Endpoint: `/api/regions/ask_question/`
```python
POST /api/regions/ask_question/

Body:
{
  "question": "What if we use hydroponics?",
  "crop_name": "tomato",
  "region_name": "Gale Crater (Rocknest)",
  "score": 4,
  "conversation_history": [
    {"question": "...", "answer": "..."}
  ]
}

Response:
{
  "question": "What if we use hydroponics?",
  "answer": "Hydroponics could improve...",
  "enabled": true,
  "crop": "tomato",
  "region": "Gale Crater (Rocknest)"
}
```

### Frontend (`SiteDetailsPanel.jsx`)

#### New State Management:
```javascript
const [conversation, setConversation] = useState([])
const [currentQuestion, setCurrentQuestion] = useState('')
const [askingQuestion, setAskingQuestion] = useState(false)
```

#### Q&A Handler:
```javascript
const handleAskQuestion = async () => {
  // Get region match for score
  // Send question with context
  // Add to conversation history
  // Clear input
}
```

#### UI Components:
1. **Conversation History** - Shows all Q&A pairs
2. **Question Input** - Textarea with examples
3. **Ask Button** - Submit question
4. **Loading State** - "Thinking..." spinner

## 🧪 Test Results

### Test 1: Initial Question
```
Question: "What if we use hydroponics instead?"
Crop: Tomato
Region: Gale Crater (Rocknest)

Answer: "Hydroponics could improve tomato growth at Rocknest 
by addressing the poor soil quality and limited water availability. 
A closed-loop hydroponic system would recycle water and nutrients, 
crucial for resource conservation. Consider incorporating a controlled 
environment like a greenhouse to regulate temperature and light, 
maximizing tomato yields despite Gale Crater's challenging conditions."

✅ Concise, specific, actionable!
```

### Test 2: Follow-up Question (with context)
```
Previous: "What if we use hydroponics instead?"
Previous Answer: "Hydroponics could improve tomato growth..."

Question: "How much water would that need daily?"

Answer: "Daily water needs for tomatoes at Rocknest, even with 
hydroponics, are challenging to estimate due to the Martian environment. 
Earth-based hydroponic tomatoes typically require 1-2 liters of water 
per plant daily, but expect significant adjustments on Mars, perhaps 
needing less due to controlled humidity and recycling. Closely monitor 
your plants and adjust based on observed needs to optimize water use 
in the resource-limited Martian environment."

✅ Contextually aware, builds on previous answer!
```

### Test 3: Alternative Suggestions
```
Question: "Why can't we grow this in winter?"

Answer: "Mars doesn't have traditional seasons like Earth, but 
sunlight intensity varies by latitude. At Gale Crater's equatorial 
position, tomatoes could potentially grow year-round with artificial 
lighting during lower-light periods. Consider LED grow lights timed 
to provide 16-18 hours of light daily for optimal tomato production."

✅ Explains why + provides alternatives!
